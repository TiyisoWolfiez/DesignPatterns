Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design that have been developed by experienced software engineers. They provide a way to standardize and improve the design of software systems, making them easier to maintain, modify, and extend. In C++, there are many different design patterns that can be used, but we will cover some of the most common ones.

## Types of Design Patterns:
  1. Creational Patterns
  2. Behavioural Patterns
  3. Structural Patterns
