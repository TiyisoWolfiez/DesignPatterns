# Smart Home Automation Project

## Overview

This project is a `Smart Home Automation System` built in C++, showcasing various object-oriented design patterns, including `Command Pattern`, `Adapter Pattern`, and `Macro Commands`. It enables the simulation of smart home devices, such as lights, thermostats, and door locks, and allows for automation routines.

We also ensure the correctness and stability of the system through `unit tests` using `Google Test`, and perform `memory leak analysis` using `Valgrind`.
